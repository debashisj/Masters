Dr. Assadullah,

This is my individual contribution to the project. My role in this project is as a Developer.

Project Plan

My first job was to create a POC (proof of concept) for speech-to-text functionality and how to connect it to different proposed modules.
So I created the Work breakdown structure so that it would be easy to modularize the project which will enable us to estimate the project accurately.
Keeping non-cloud libraries in mind I created the cost/schedule for the project.
I helped the team in getting the list of software versions for section 6.7.1. I explained to the teammates how it is subject to change as we move ahead with the project and practically implement the application.
I spent about 10 hours in creating the POC (which I haven't had success yet) and 2 hours in coming up with the WBS and the schedule.


SRS

For the SRS, I worked on specific use cases 1 and 2.
I used Pencil software to create the mockups and shared the pencil file with the teammates, so that they can use it as templates for the rest of the mockups.
I spent about 4 hours on the SRS document.


Thanks,

Debashis Jena
